Elon Musk’s Tesla leads the pack in electric vehicle design and innovation. The original Roadster is still in the collection but has since been joined by the Model 3 and S sedans, Model X and Y SUVs, and the space-age-looking Cybertruck. Telsa ranks high in technological innovation and impressive driving distance. The Model 3 was also originally classified as the Best Electic Car in the Consumer Reports top picks. However, this was repealed due to changes in standard feature inclusions, such as dropping radar for camera-based automatic emergency braking.</p></center></p></font>

The Mazda CX-30 is also listed in the top ten vehicles as the best Subcompact SUV. The company has been in business since 1920, with a brand essence to ‘celebrate driving,’ making fun-to-drive models across the range.

Generally, they’re a comfortable ride, with a good fit and finish, agile handling, and a more premium feel than similar brands. Additionally, they feature FCW and AEB as standard in most models. However, the reliability lets the brand down, especially in the SUV models. The yet-to-be-released ID.4 is the latest innovation from the German brand. It’s a long-range electric vehicle that has a striking road presence and a spacious, comfortable cabin.</font></p></center></p></font>

Some of the models, including the C, E, and S class sedans and GLS and GLE SUVs, performed well under scrutiny. In general, they had a plush, luxury ride, beautiful interiors and styling, crisp handling, advanced safety systems, and a quiet cabin. What let them down, though, was the reliability. The German brand also has some more affordable options, including the A-Class, GLA, and GLB SUVs with an innovative electric vehicle on the way. If you’re looking for some celebrity-style street cred, choose the G-Class, also colloquially known as a G-Wagon (but good luck getting the Post Malone song out of your head).</p></center></p></font>

	 <font size="+5"><p> <center><center><p  font size="+2"h1{text-align: left;}>Automobili Lamborghini S.p.A. (Italian pronunciation: [autoˈmɔːbili lamborˈɡiːni]) is an Italian manufacturer of luxury sports cars and SUVs based in Sant'Agata Bolognese. The company is owned by the Volkswagen Group through its subsidiary Audi.

Ferruccio Lamborghini (1916–1993), an Italian manufacturing magnate, founded Automobili Ferruccio Lamborghini S.p.A. in 1963 to compete with Ferrari. The company was noted for using a rear mid-engine, rear-wheel drive layout. Lamborghini grew rapidly during its first decade, but sales plunged in the wake of the 1973 worldwide financial downturn and the oil crisis. The firm's ownership changed three times after 1973, including a bankruptcy in 1978. American Chrysler Corporation took control of Lamborghini in 1987 and sold it to Malaysian investment group Mycom Setdco and Indonesian group V'Power Corporation in 1994. In 1998, Mycom Setdco and V'Power sold Lamborghini to the Volkswagen Group where it was placed under the control of the group's Audi division.</font></p></center></p></font>

Founded in 1939 by Enzo Ferrari (1898–1988), the company adopted its current name in 1945 and began producing its line of cars in 1947. Ferrari became a public company in 1960, and from 1963 to 2014 it was a subsidiary of Fiat S.p.A. It was spun off from Fiat's successor entity, Fiat Chrysler Automobiles, in 2016.

The company currently offers a large model range which includes several supercars, grand tourers, and one SUV. Many early Ferraris, dating to the 1950s and 1960s, count among the most expensive cars ever sold at auction. Owing to a combination of its cars, enthusiast culture, and successful licensing deals, in 2019 Ferrari was labelled the world's strongest brand by the financial consultency Brand Finance.</font></p></center></p></font>
